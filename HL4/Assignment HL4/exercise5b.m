% from which the radiance pattern is estimated windowing the signal befor

% This is the input signal. The following function computes 1/FFT(sweep). 
% We will thus need to MULTIPLY this signal for FFT(output) in order to 
% apply deconvolution
% Use the provided synthSweep function with frequency interval between 50Hz
% and 22kHz

    % Windowing the ir. In order to take into account windows of arbitrary
    % length, the ir is circularly shifted until the max peak is at the
    % middle of the array. This prevents the left boundary of the windows
    % to be out of the vector. See function circshift.

    % Use the TOA information in order to find the correct poisition of the
    % first path in the shifted signal.
    
    % Impulse response windowing
    % we want to maintain time information in the windowed impulse response.
    % We allocate one array of the same length of the original ir, and then
    % add samples from the windowed signal. Finally, we invert the
    % previously applied circShift to return back to the correct impulse
    % response timing.
