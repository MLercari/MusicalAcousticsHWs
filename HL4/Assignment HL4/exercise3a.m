% Homework 4 exercise 3a
% Evaluation of reflections in the signals
% We compute the impulse response using the white noise source signal
% from which the first direct path is computed. In addition by a visual 
% inspection we estimate the first reflection time of arrival. Both the 
% distance from the source and the distance from the reflectors are 
% computed using the estimated times.
