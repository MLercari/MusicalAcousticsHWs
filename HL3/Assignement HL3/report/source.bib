abstract = "With the growth of electronic gaming, personal electronics and the widespread creation and distribution of digital music, the ability to synthesize realistic instrument sounds is becoming more important. In particular, the ability to synthesize guitar sounds is necessary for a variety of applications. The dynamics of a string with ideal boundary conditions are well known, but the structure of an acoustic guitar presents very different boundary conditions that modify the resulting sound. We propose an approach based on measured transfer functions from a classical guitar. A transmission line is used to represent the output of a vibrating string which is then modified by a filter bank whose transfer function reproduces the driving point frequency response functions from the classical guitar. The result is a synthesized sound that reproduces much of the tonal quality of the actual instrument."
