SIDE LOAD
1) In plots named "A" we've chosen 
only 5 modes around 110 Hz
to compute the modal superposition. For this
reason, the displacement given by an oscillating
force which oscillates around 110 Hz seems
accurate (see picture "A1" ) while it is 
not when the frequency
of the force is higher than the modal frequency
refered to the fifth mode (262.91 Hz) (see picture "A2")
2) In plots named "B" instead we increased 
number of modes around the same 
previous eigenfrequency and then we increased
the number of modes 
into the superposition and therefore the results 
are both more accurate
